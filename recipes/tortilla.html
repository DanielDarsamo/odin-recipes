    <p>Having a tasty tortilla as breakfast is one of those meals that will make you want to conquer the world by 10:00 AM.</p>
    <p>So lets get down to business and cook this tortilla</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
  
      
<h2>Directions</h2>

<div class="steps " id="one"> Step 1</div>
    <p>
        Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices. 

    </p>
<div class="steps " id="two"> Step 2 </div>
    <p>
        Combine eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and whisk very thoroughly; set aside. 

    </p>

    <div class="steps " id="three"> Step 3 </div> 
    <p>Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a large nonstick pan and set heat to medium-high.
        <br>Add potatoes, onions, and remaining salt.
        <br> Cook, tossing and stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some onions and potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
        <br> Between stirrings, cover potatoes to reduce cooking time and keep in moisture.
        <br> For less browning, reduce heat to medium. 
     </p>

<div class="steps " id="four">Step 4 </div>
<p>Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. </p>

<div class="steps " id="five">Step 5 </div>
<p>Add remaining olive oil to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan over medium-high heat.
    <br> Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth the top.
    <br> Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the bottom is browned and the edges of tortilla begin to firm up. 
</p>

<div class="steps " id="six">Step 6</div>
<p>Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another plate, and flip the plates over to invert.
    <br> Slide tortilla back into the pan, and place back over medium-high heat.
</p>

<div class="steps " id="seven">Step 7</div>
<p> Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2 minutes more. 
   <br> Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed in the middle with a finger if eggs are fully cooked. 
   <br> If it feels soft or mushy when pressed, cook for a few minutes more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than fully set.
 </p>

<div class="steps" id="eight">Step 8 </div>
<p>Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or room temperature. </p>
